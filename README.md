# eventspot
When you start the EventSpot app, it will open to the My Events Page. It will say EventSpot at the
top and otherwise be empty, because there are no events yet. There is a side menu accessible by
clicking the menu button at the top left of the screen, giving 3 options: My Events (where you are
now), EventSpot Map, and Create an Event.

Go to Create an Event first. Filling in the requested
fields (Event name, a brief description, and address as well as time and date entries from a clock
and calendar, respectively, and the type of event from radial buttons) creates an event with those
characteristics. Pressing the "OK" button stores this event and returns you to a page saying "Submit
a new Event!" with a button to return to the Event Creation screen to make another event.

From here, click on the menu button again and choose the EventSpot map. The app will show a screen
that reads "Spot an Event near you!" with a button saying "Open Map." The first time you run the app
and click this button, you may be asked permission for the phone to access your location. You will
then see a map. Scanning to where you placed your event will show a pin on the map where your event
is located. The pin will be an icon based on the type of event you chose; Concerts will have a
guitar, seminars will have a graduation cap, parties will have a party hat, and sports will have
a hockey stick and puck. If your event is located near you, it may be helpful to click on the
compass rose icon in the top right corner of the screen to center the map on your current location.
Clicking on the pin will also display the information about your event that you entered.

Returning to the My Events page (using the Menu button again) will now show information about your
event as well. It lists your given title, what type of event it is, what time it starts, the date,
and the location. When the number of events is large enough to overfill the page, it scrolls up and
down when swiped to show all of the information available across all events.
